# Examples

Xbee_Transmitter_User_Split_Packets.ino and Xbee_Receiver_User_Split_Packets.ino:

These examples provide a way to measuring the maximum throughput that can be achieve in single or multi-hop Zigbee mesh network.

Xbee_Transmitter_Delay.ino and Xbee_Receiver_Delay.ino:

These example provide a way to measure the packet delay for a single or multi-hop Zigbee mesh network.
